<p>Hey - so cool announcement for workshop members. </p>

<p>	<strong>I'll be interviewing Nick Disabato tomorrow at 10am PST</strong> and broadcasting it out to you live.</p> 
<p>Nick is a great guy who has tons of experience working with startups and optimizing his freelance business.</p>


<p>He sends an awesome newsletter about interaction design and freelancing, which if you haven't checked out, <a href="http://nickd.org/">you should</a>.</p>

<p>He crowd-funded <a href="http://cadence.cc/">a book on interaction design</a>... which was a compilation of evergreen principles he picked up from client work.</p> 


<p><strong>But probably the coolest thing he's done is productize his consulting services</strong> - and in the process create a large, EXTREMELY STEADY source of income. Check out his awesome landing page for his product: <a href="http://draft.nu/revise/">draft revise.</a></p>

<p>If you can't tell, he's a really great person to ask about taking your freelance business to the next level.</p>


<p>
He reached out to me because he was interested in joining workshop - and I invited him to join us tomorrow at 10am PST - for a live interview.</p>

<p>That's not all, I also got him to do a 30-minute Q+A with you guys via a campfire chat --- So come ready to ask questions and pick his brain.</p>

<p><strong>I'll be sending out an email tomorrow with the link for you guys to attend, so clear out your calendar and make sure you're at your computer tomorrow; Wednesday December 11 2013 at 10am PST.</strong></p>

<p>
Until tomorrow,</p>
<p>-- Robert</p>

<p>PS. I won't be recording the event, so don't miss out - it's a one-time only deal. Looking forward to chatting with you and getting to know more about your business!
